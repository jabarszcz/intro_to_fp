# Introduction to functional programming

Functional programming concepts and examples in Haskell and Erlang

---
## What is functional programming (FP) ?

It is a programming paradigm where...

- **General (weak) definition**  
  Functions are first-class citizens, making higher-order functions possible.

- **(Pure) functional programming**  
  Functions behave like mathematical functions. (No side-effects or
  mutable data)

---
## Concepts of FP

---
### First-class and higher-order functions

---
### Currying

---
### Pattern matching

---
### Pure functions / referential transparency

---
### Recursion instead of looping constructs

---
### Laziness (Evaluation Strategy)

---
### Type System

---
### Persistent Data structures

---
## More on Haskell

- Purely functional language
- Lazy (non-strict) evaluation strategy
- Strongly typed (Hindley-Milner type system)
- Garbage-Collected

### Haskell syntax basics

+++
### Types and Typeclasses

+++
### A brief explanation of monads

---
## More on Erlang

- Not pure (stateful processes), but single assignement
- Strict evaluation strategy
- Dynamically typed
- Garbage-Collected

+++
### Erlang syntax basics

+++
### Example of a stateful process: the digraph server

+++
### Cool and advanced features of Erlang

- Built-in concurrency features like message-passing and supervision
  trees ease the writing of fault-tolerant software.
- It is possible to hot swap code!

+++
### Erlang resources

- The book [_Learn You Some Erlang for great good!_](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/)
  is a nice intro
