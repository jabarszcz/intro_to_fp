# Introduction to functional programming

This a short talk I plan to give to my undergraduate colleagues as a
preparation for the [2018 CS Games Competition](http://2018.csgames.org/),
where one of the challenges will involve functional programming.

The presentation is [available online](https://gitpitch.com/jabarszcz/intro_to_fp).
